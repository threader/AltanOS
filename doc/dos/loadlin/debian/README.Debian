loadlin for Debian
------------------

You will find loadlin.exe.gz in /usr/lib/loadlin. Copy that file
plus a kernel (and optionally ramdisk contents) to your dos partition,
and ungzip it with gzip -d loadlin.exe.
Read the instructions and then you should be able to boot Linux
from DOS.
Note the additional tool `freeramdisk' in the loadlin package which is a
tool for freeing up the allocated ramdisk.
